Here's what you get with it.\r\n\r\n* meteor-boilerplate console tool, for scaffolding files and more\r\n* Essential atmosphere packages included, like [Iron Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router)\r\n* Profile support for ES6 and Coffeescript\r\n\r\nThe boilerplate looks like following: [boilerplate.meteor.com](http://boilerplate.meteor.com). Have a look at [starthacking](http://starthacking.meteor.com/) for a project created with this boilerplate.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\nFirst, [download](https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-boilerplate/zipball/master) and unpack the boilerplate archive.\r\n```sh\r\n# Assuming meteor is already installed\r\ncd /path/to/project/\r\nmeteor\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n```sh\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate # Lists all possible commands\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate create:module # Interactive console for command\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate create:module loginBox # Executes it immediately\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Removing default code\r\n\r\nThere's already a lot of predefined code in this boilerplate, to show you the possible functionality. However, if you want to start off with an\r\nempty project, use the provided command to get rid off all the code you don't need.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate reset:project\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Available profiles\r\n\r\n* coffee (coffeescript, Unfancy JavaScript)\r\n* es6 (traceur, Traceur is a JavaScript.next-to-JavaScript-of-today compiler)\r\n\r\nYou can change your profile like that\r\n```sh\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate change:profile coffee\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso use the ```reset:project``` command to start off with blank files according to your profile.\r\n\r\n### Deployments\r\n\r\nSupport for [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) is integrated, use following commands to set up your deployment process.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate mup:init # walks you through the setup process\r\nnode meteor-boilerplate mup:deploy # deploys to server\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Packages used\r\n\r\n* standard-app-packages\r\n* less\r\n* jquery\r\n* underscore\r\n* accounts-password\r\n* accounts-ui\r\n* aldeed:collection2\r\n* iron:router\r\n* raix:handlebar-helpers\r\n* nooitaf:semantic-ui-less\r\n\r\nThe \"insecure\" and \"autopublish\" packages are removed by default (they make your app vulnerable).\r\n\r\n### Folder structure\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient/ \t\t\t\t# Client folder\r\n    compatibility/      # Libraries which create a global variable\r\n    config/             # Configuration files (on the client)\r\n\tlib/                # Library files that get executed first\r\n    startup/            # Javascript files on Meteor.startup()\r\n    stylesheets         # LESS files\r\n    subscriptions/      # Collection subscriptions(*)\r\n    modules/            # Meant for components, such as form and more(*)\r\n\tviews/\t\t\t    # Contains all views(*)\r\n\t    common/         # General purpose html templates\r\nmodel/  \t\t\t\t# Model files, for each Meteor.Collection(*)\r\nprivate/                # Private files\r\npublic/                 # Public files\r\nroutes/                 # All routes(*)\r\nserver/\t\t\t\t\t# Server folder\r\n    fixtures/           # Meteor.Collection fixtures defined\r\n    lib/                # Server side library folder\r\n    publications/       # Collection publications(*)\r\n    startup/            # On server startup\r\nmeteor-boilerplate\t\t# Command line tool\r\n```\r\n\r\n(*) = the command line tool creates files in these folders\r\n\r\n## Other Awesome Boilerplates\r\n\r\n- [Void](https://github.com/SachaG/Void) by Sacha Greif\r\n- [meteor-jw-opinionated-skeleton](https://github.com/jamesdwilson/meteor-jw-opinionated-skeleton) by jamesdwilson (CoffeeScript)\r\n- [meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/BeDifferential/meteor-boilerplate) by BeDifferential (CoffeeScript)\r\n- [em](https://github.com/EventedMind/em) by EventedMind (Boilerplate & Scaffolding)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis boilerplate has an MIT License, see the LICENSE.txt for more information.\r\n","google":"UA-45133006-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
