## Technologies used

There's a good overview on the [boilerplate homepage](http://meteor-boilerplate.surge.sh/).

## Why this stack?

I've tried to use technologies that have been helpful these past few years for projects that I've worked on. 
Here are some links  that explain or explore technologies and approaches that can be used with this boilerplate.

* [Rationalizing functional css](https://marcelosomers.com/writing/rationalizing-functional-css/) (with tachyons)
* [Mobile first](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933)
* [An open letter regarding semicolons](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding) (standardjs has no semicolons)

Regarding frontend libraries this boilerplate isn't very opinionated. This project uses blaze by default, but it's easy to
 change to other popular frontend libraries such as [React](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) or [Vue](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-meteor).

### Generating files

With [orion-cli](https://github.com/matteodem/orion-cli) you can scaffold files based on the configuration of the boilerplate.

```sh
orion generate component
```

You can create components, models etc. and reset the project with the console tool (see below).
